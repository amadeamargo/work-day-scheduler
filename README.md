# work-day-scheduler

The workday planner is a tool for busy individuals to keep track of their daily schedule. The current date and time is displayed at the very top of the calendar. 
The calendar has nine one-hour time slots from 9am-5pm.  

At a glance, users are able to tell the current time block, which is highlighted in red. Grey time slots signify the time has passed. Time slots in the future are colored green. 

To add an event to the schedule, simply click on the time block. An input form will appear, allowing users to note their event. Click on the save button to add the event to the calendar.
